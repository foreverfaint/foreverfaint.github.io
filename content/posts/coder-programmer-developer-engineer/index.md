**Coder** is somebody, who translates the design or the pre-defined logic into a compute language. A **coder**  is a labor, or a worker. 

**Programmer** is somebody, who is doing something more than coding. A **programmer** cares about understanding theory, optimization, efficiency, beauty, and art, even zen. **programming** is usually not related to any finance goal, it is for fun and spirit. 

**Developer** is somebody, who achieves a goal by writing the code. He focus on goal and problem solving. It means if the goal need data analysis, he will do it; if the goal need him (Java developer) to write a Perl script, he will do it; If the goal need a comprehensive online documentation, he will do it. Therefore app marketplace uses **developer** to name the person, who builds an app (which serve a business demand) on platform.
